<h3 id="340---july-28-2022"><strong>3.4.0 - July 28, 2022</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>New Policies
    <ul>
      <li>Industrial fuel shifting is now controlled by two policy levers.  A new lever allows use of indusrtial heat pumps to electrify low-temperature heat.  The existing lever now governs only medium and high temperature heat and continues to allow shifting to electricity, hydrogen, and/or other fuels.</li>
      <li>New Policy: CO<sub>2</sub> storage in agricultural soils from altered tillage and other soil practices</li>
      <li>New Policy: CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration due to avoided conversion and restoration of grasslands</li>
      <li>New Policy: CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration due to wetland restoration</li>
      <li>New Policy: Carbon border adjustments (regarding carbon pricing) can now be toggled on and off. For the U.S., we assume border adjustments are off by default.</li>
      <li>New Policy: The F-gas Equipment Maintenance &amp; Retrofits policy is now subscripted by both the chemicals and other metals (aluminum) industry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features
    <ul>
      <li>Import and export substitution (the extent to which the policy package increases or decreases imports and exports of non-energy products) are now calculated.  (The EPS already handled import and export substitution for energy products.) This also allows the model to calculate domestic consumption and changes in consumption.</li>
      <li>Users may now override endogenous learning for battery electric vehicles (in trans/BNVP)</li>
      <li>Labor productivity growth rates now support time series data (io-model/LPGRbIC)</li>
      <li>Demand response now reduces the need for generation from peaker power plants</li>
      <li>Capital costs of electricity sector CCS equipment are now properly adjusted to account for power plant capacity factors</li>
      <li>Single-pollutant graphs are now stacked area graphs (by sector) instead of single-line graphs</li>
      <li>Whether the carbon tax exempts process emissions by default (ctrl-settings/BEPEfCT), and the policy lever to reverse this behavior, can now be set separately for each industry</li>
      <li>The model’s handling of value-added taxes (VAT) and sales taxes is now more sophisticated and accurate.</li>
      <li>The Macroeconomic Feedbacks sheet is clearer and easier to understand.</li>
      <li>The policy schedule Python script (plcy-schd/FoPITY) now includes internal error checking capabilities.</li>
      <li>Improved the metrics used to calculate macroeconomic feedback for transportation service demand.</li>
      <li>Added the ability for government to rebate carbon tax on exported products (if carbon border adjustments are enabled), with a new control setting to toggle this behavior on or orr.</li>
      <li>Edited or added smoothing times for electricity generation capacity, grid battery storage, transmission capital costs, and electricity prices (in files elec/STfESCE and elec/STfEPC) to spread power sector capital costs over a number of years</li>
      <li>Exogenous GDP growth rate adjustment (ctrl-settings/EGGRA) now accepts time-series input data and can be toggled on and off in the web interface via a control lever</li>
      <li>BAU control lever settings are now read from input data by the web app and no longer need to be specified in a Scenario_BAU.cin file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Graphs
    <ul>
      <li>Exports, imports, production, and domestic consumption of nonenergy products, as well as policy-induced changes in these metrics</li>
      <li>Share of electricity generation from clean sources</li>
      <li>Carbon intensity of electricity generation</li>
      <li>Electricity intensity per unit GDP</li>
      <li>Industrial CO2 by source type (energy vs. process)</li>
      <li>Industrial process CO2 emissions by industry</li>
      <li>Industrial energy-related CO2 emissions by industry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fix to share of demand response capacity costs by cash flow entity</li>
      <li>Revert to using ALLOCATE AVAILABLE() for electricity dispatch (as in EPS 3.3.0) rather than a logit function</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data
    <ul>
      <li>Updated to the Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2022. We chose to use the Low Economic Growth side case because it more closely aligns with economic projections from the Congressional Budget Office.</li>
      <li>Updated to use the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Annual Technology Baseline 2022</li>
      <li>Updated BAU to reflect components of the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</li>

      <li>Updated to use the International Energy Agency Methane Tracker 2022 for process methane</li>
      <li>Updated direct air capture potential</li>
      <li>Updated control settings to specify that all fuel prices should be affected by changes in fuel production costs</li>
      <li>Updated control settings to exempt certain process emissions from the carbon tax by default</li>
      <li>Updated cost of transmission</li>
      <li>Updated cost of industrial energy efficiency policy</li>
      <li>Updated vehicle maintenance costs</li>
      <li>Other minor data updates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3311---may-11-2022"><strong>3.3.1.1 - May 11, 2022</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fix to allow for different values of electricity dispatch shareweights for each power plant type (file elec/MOfEDS, which includes an option to manually override the model’s calculated shareweights)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="331---jan-18-2022"><strong>3.3.1 - Jan. 18, 2022</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>New Features
    <ul>
      <li>Electricity Sector
        <ul>
          <li>Electricity generation subsidies can now be set separately for power plants of the same type in different quality tiers (both BAU and policy lever)</li>
          <li>Electricity dispatch choice is now handled via a logit function rather than ALLOCATE AVAILABLE.  Logit shareweights are calculated endogenously and are policy-responsive.  A manual override for these shareweights has been added, allowing detailed customization of electricity dispatch behavior for regions with unusual electricity dispatch approaches.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Transportation Sector
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in the amount of money paid for passenger transport fares (airfare, bus fare, train fare) are now calculated.</li>
          <li>Annual vehicle insurance costs for all on-road vehicles are now included.</li>
          <li>Annual vehicle parking costs are now included.</li>
          <li>Annual vehicle licensing, registration, and property tax costs are now included.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The fuel tax policy can now be used to reduce the BAU tax rate or apply subsidies.  Positive values increase the tax rate.  Negative values reduce the BAU tax rate or apply subsidies.</li>
      <li>Added single-line graphs of total energy use for each end use sector.  Breakdowns showing total energy use as stacked area graphs already existed, but a single-line graph is sometimes preferable for simplicity or for comparing multiple policy packages on the same graph.</li>
      <li>Policy schedules (FoPITY) are now managed by a single Python script rather than via several large Excel files.  This allows policies to be added and changed more easily, policy schedules are generated more quickly, and there is no longer any risk of policy properties not aligning across different Excel files.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>“Buy In-Region” policy lever’s direct effects are now included in macroecnomic feedback loops, plus other formula fixes for this policy</li>

      <li>Corrected formula for exclusion of deaths caused by pollution associated with imported electricity for EPS regions that count emissions from imported electricity</li>
      <li>The change in demand for the “energy pipelines and gas processing” industry is now based on the change in domestic + exported natural gas demand, rather than natural gas production, to better handle regions with gas transmission but little-to-no gas production</li>
      <li>Fixed omission of geoengineering primary energy use from “Primary Energy Use by Sector” and Fuel Costs graphs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data Updates
    <ul>
      <li>Updated BAU trajectory to incorporate the AIM Act</li>
      <li>Updated BAU carbon capture and sequestration amounts in industry based on a Rhodium analysis</li>
      <li>Updated currency year to 2020</li>
      <li>Separated combined cycle, steam turbine, and combustion turbine natural gas plants in the input data</li>
      <li>Updated battery storage costs and recalibrated vehicle prices</li>
      <li>Corrected BAU Production Tax Credit values for onshore wind</li>
      <li>Other minor data updates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="330---aug-16-2021"><strong>3.3.0 - Aug. 16, 2021</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>New Features
    <ul>
      <li>New Policy: Buy In-Region Products allows the user to specify a percentage of imported products (in the BAU case) that are shifted to domestic suppliers (in the policy case) for each individual industry.</li>
      <li>Added demographic breakdowns disaggregating changes in lives saved due to reduced pollution by sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino status.  New graphs show results as absolute numbers and as percent changes relative to BAU.</li>
      <li>The EPS core model structure now supports model run end dates as far out as 2100.  Each EPS region’s developers may choose their preferred model run end date.  (The U.S. national model’s end date remains 2050.)</li>
      <li>New Policy: N<sub>2</sub>O abatement (from the chemicals industry, primarily from nitric and adipic acid production)</li>
      <li>Projected future changes in BAU Output, BAU Employment, BAU Value Added, and BAU Employee Compensation disaggregated by ISIC code improve the accuracy of some input/output model results</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data Updates
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Minor Updates
    <ul>
      <li>The carbon tax is no longer levied on industrial feedstocks (such as the natural gas that goes into plastics, or the crude oil that goes into secondary petroleum products). This avoids double-taxation of crude and secondary petroleum products.</li>
      <li>The model now ensures input data for BAU fuel production, consumption, imports, and exports are in balance, with behavior customizable in variable fuels/FPIEBP</li>
      <li>Added district heat losses in heat distribution systems</li>
      <li>Building retrofitting policy effects are now cumulative with the effects of other buildings sector policies that affect the energy efficiency of newly sold building components</li>
      <li>Subscript battery share of electric vehicle price by Vehicle Type</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>In models configured to treat emissions associated with imported electricity as in-region emissions, exclude these emissions from health impact calculations</li>
      <li>Use BEA domestic requirements table instead of BEA total requirements table when splitting certain ISIC codes in io-table/DLIM</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Edited 1.5 °C Scenario</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="310---dec-9-2020"><strong>3.1.0 - Dec. 9, 2020</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>New Features
    <ul>
      <li>Policy implementation schedules may now be set separately for every subscripted element of every policy lever.  For example, this allows different start dates for energy efficiency standards applied to the steel industry vs. the cement industry.  (Each industry is an element of the “industrial energy efficiency standards” policy lever.)</li>
      <li>Improved procedure for allocating responsibility for emissions abatement amongst policies within a policy package, used in calculating wedge thicknesses in the wedge diagram and box widths in the cost curve.  A description of the improved procedure <a href="https://github.com/Energy-Innovation/eps-us/issues/119">can be found here</a>.</li>

      <li>The Transportation Demand Management (TDM) lever has been overhauled and renamed Mode Shifting.  It now uses a new data approach that is easier to internationalize and is subscripted by vehicle type as well as cargo type, allowing finer control in policy scenarios.</li>
      <li>Added output graph of sources of change in government cash flow</li>
      <li>New control lever allows exclusion of emissions from generating exported electricity</li>
      <li>In EPS regional models that use hard-coded renewable energy capacity construction costs (i.e., those that disabled endogenous learning), soft costs now reduce the effect of the capital cost R&amp;D lever and can be reduced using the soft cost reduction policy lever</li>
      <li>Time-series power plant fixed and variable O&amp;M input data may now be used (elec/CCaMC)</li>

  <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed rounding error in hydrogen capital equipment costs</li>
      <li>The construction industry’s ISIC code is no longer part of the “other industries” category ISIC codes, correcting some minor issues where too many cash flows were assigned to the construction industry</li>
      <li>Certain cash flows to ISIC codes within the “other industries” category are now allocated based on utility or energy spending rather than output</li>

    <ul>
      <li>An economic input/output (I/O) model has been added as a component of the Energy Policy Simulator.</li>
      <li>New output metrics include the change in gross domestic product (GDP), employment (jobs), total employee compensation, average compensation per employee, number of union and non-union jobs, government spending, budget deficit/surplus, household tax revenue, payroll tax revenue, corporate income tax revenue, size of the national debt, and interest paid on the national debt.</li>
      <li>Changes in GDP, jobs, and compensation can also be visualized disaggregated by economic sector or by their direct, indirect, and induced components.</li>
      <li>Respending of changes in cash flow for government, households, and industries is now accounted for, providing a holistic look at policy impacts on economic activity.</li>
      <li>New Government Revenue Accounting (GRA) settings allows the user to specify how government raises or spends changes in revenue caused by the policy package.  Options include changes in regular spending, deficit spending, household taxes, payroll taxes, and corporate income taxes.</li>
      <li>Feedback loops from the I/O model to the Transportation, Buildings, and Industry sectors capture the energy demand and emissions associated with indirect and induced economic activity.</li>
      <li>A new <a href="io-model.html">documentation page</a> explains the I/O model in detail.</li>
      <li>We gratefully acknowledge the invaluable contributions of the <a href="https://www.aceee.org/">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy</a> (ACEEE), <a href="https://www.barretteconomics.com/">Jim Barrett</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/skip-laitner-746b124/">Skip Laitner</a> for their guidance and advice in implementing this feature, and for allowing us to learn from the <a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/pdf/fact-sheet/DEEPER_Methodology.pdf">DEEPER I/O model</a>, originally created by Skip Laitner.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Improved Public Health Calculations
    <ul>
      <li>In addition to the policy package’s effects on premature mortality (introduced in version 1.0.3), the EPS now calculates impacts on 10 additional health outcomes, including lost workdays, hospital admissions, non-fatal heart attacks, asthma attacks, respiratory symptoms and bronchitis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data Updates
    <ul>
      <li>First simulated year advanced from 2018 to 2019</li>
      <li>Data in input variables based on EIA Annual Energy Outlook updated to use AEO 2020 values</li>
      <li>Various other input data updates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Other Improvements
    <ul>
      <li>Industry Sector
        <ul>
          <li>Industrial process emissions multipliers (used in indst/BPEiC and indst/PERAC) are now disaggregated by gas.  These multipliers now allow for replacement of BPEiC data with arbitary, user-specified data while keeping abatement potentials and costs in PERAC in sync with BPEiC.</li>
          <li>Added revenue data for “water &amp; waste” industry (water treatment, wastewater, solid waste collection, landfilling, recycling, etc.)</li>
          <li>Use of the material efficiency policy on the chemicals industry and on the other industries category is now disallowed because these industry categories are aggregates in our new I/O data (chemicals includes pharmaceuticals), and the material efficiency cannot target only the relevant parts of these aggregates to obtain accurate financial outcomes</li>
          <li>Industry now can pass on a share of its policy-driven changes in expenditures to buyers of its products (specified in indst/SoCiIEPTtB).  Removed embedded carbon and associated cost calculations for vehicles, power plants, and building components, to avoid double-counting.  (The new approach covers all products in the economy and all sources of expenditure changes, not just a carbon tax.)</li>
          <li>The model now accounts for more different types of costs that are passed through to buyers when calculating the policy-driven change in industrial production, such as the costs of capital equipment purchased in response to energy efficiency standards and the costs of implementing process emissions abatement policies.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Electricity Sector
        <ul>
          <li>Peak power demand calculations now calculate summer and winter peaks separately</li>
          <li>Peak power demand calculations use equipment load factors (elec/ELF) to more accurately determine peak demand, which is particularly important in scenarios with substantial electrification</li>
          <li>Users may now override endogenous learning for electricity generation capacity by specifying time series capital costs in elec/CCaMC</li>
          <li>Imported electricity price and BAU exported electricity price may now be customized</li>
          <li>Balance of system is now included in grid battery costs (and is unaffected by endogenous learning)</li>
          <li>Soft costs for onshore wind, offshore wind, and solar PV power plants (and distributed solar PV) now accept time-series BAU data</li>
          <li>Power plant fuel type shifting (such as coal-to-gas retrofits) will now only occur if the target power plant type is economic (not subject to economically-driven early retirement) or if the target fuel is a drop-in replacement (i.e. no retrofitting required).</li>
          <li>Grid battery policy is now set as a fraction of potential capacity achieved rather than as a percentage growth rate, allowing for finer control over timing and quantity of grid battery deployment</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fuels
        <ul>
          <li>Added output graphs of Embedded CO2 in Exported Fuels and Change in Embedded CO2 in Exported Fuels</li>
          <li>The carbon tax rate may now be explicitly set for District Heat and Hydrogen sector instead of inheriting the Industry sector rate</li>
          <li>Fuels cost input data and Vensim sheet reorganized for clarity and ease of adaptation to other regions</li>
          <li>Change in carbon tax revenue and change in fuel tax revenue are now calculated explicitly, to support new government revenue handling options</li>
          <li>Reduced domestic demand for domestically-produced fuels is now partially compensated for by increased exports (fuels/PoFDCtAE)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Buildings Sector
        <ul>
          <li>Implemented cash flows for efficient building component rebate policy</li>
          <li>Building fuel shifting policy now accounts for incremental capital costs of electrified (i.e. heat pump) building heating systems and water heaters</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Other
        <ul>
          <li>WebAppData now detects duplicate and missing policy ID numbers</li>
          <li>The model no longer uses GET DIRECT DATA to access data from outside of the model run timeframe</li>
          <li>Model structure diagram updated to show new economic and public health outputs</li>
          <li>Fraction of technology outside modeled region that affects endogenous learning can now be customized (endo-learn/FoTOMRAEL)</li>
          <li>All Python scripts now include the capability to limit the time range of data written to output files</li>
          <li>Policy package CapEx + OpEx and Cost Curve output graphs now respond to user’s government revenue handling selections to determine revenue neutrality</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed off-by-one-year error in cement process CO2 multipliers (indst/BPEiC) and two missing formulas for cement (indst/PERAC)</li>
      <li>Do not exclude heat as a fuel type that can power industry CCS</li>
      <li>Added geoengineering sector to energy-related CO2 output graphs</li>
      <li>Limited effect of building component labeling policy to affected market share (bldgs/PPEIdtIL)</li>
      <li>Fixed formula error in “Change in Amount Spent on Vehicle Maintenance”</li>
      <li>Fixed double-counting of certain cash flow changes due to changes in industrial production</li>
      <li>Very high carbon tax rates applied to industrial process (non-energy) emissions can no longer cause oscillating production changes</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in “Subsidy Paid on Distributed Solar Capacity” formula</li>
      <li>Capital costs for new CCS equipment are now allocated amongst power plant types and amongst industries proportionally to year-over-year increase in CCS usage instead of total current-year CCS usage by each plant type and industry</li>
      <li>Power plant decommissioning costs are no longer charged if a power plant type has retired to zero and there is no capacity left to retire</li>
      <li>The industrial fuel shifting policy’s capital equipment costs now account for increases in usage of all industrial fuel types</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="212---july-9-2020"><strong>2.1.2 - July 9, 2020</strong></h3>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="211-us-v2---may-12-2020"><strong>2.1.1-us-v2 - May 12, 2020</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Updated COVID-19 recession’s GDP impact and elasticities of sectoral-energy-use-to-GDP using latest data from EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (ctrl-settings/GDPGR, ctrl-settings/EoSEUwGDPiR, plcy-schd/FoPITY)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="211---may-12-2020"><strong>2.1.1 - May 12, 2020</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Major Improvements
    <ul>
      <li>Added capability to simulate COVID-19 recession impacts, adjustable in the web interface via a policy-like slider and implementation schedule.  This simulates effects of exogenous GDP changes on demand for energy, energy-using services, and products.  It can be adapted for different countries or reconfigured to represent other economic recessions (or booms) via updated input data.</li>
      <li>The CCS policy lever has been overhauled.  It now is set in terms of a percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> captured, is subscripted by sector (electricity and industry sectors), and can be used to capture industrial process CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> from fuel burned to power the CCS process itself.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Minor Improvements
    <ul>
      <li>Added graphs of industry sector energy-related CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions by industry and by pollutant to web interface</li>
      <li>Vehicle maintenance costs are now included and are considered in vehicle technology selection</li>
      <li>When new peaker plants are built to meet peak electricity demand, cost-based allocation is used instead of allocating proportinally to existing peaker capacity</li>
      <li>Output graph definitions in WebAppData now have an include/exclude flag, and localizing units is easier thanks to a new unit selection tab</li>
      <li>Added three <em>X</em>-per-unit-BAU-GDP output graphs to WebAppData (unflagged for U.S.) to support regions where this metric is commonly used, such as India</li>
      <li>Non-country multipliers for industrial process emissions (indst/BPEiC and indst/PERAC) now accept time series values</li>
      <li>Updated input data in elec/ARpUIiRC, elec/BCRbQ, elec/BECF, elec/BRPSPTY, elec/DRC, elec/DRCo, elec/CCaMC, elec/MCGLT, fuels/BCFpUEbS, and trans/BVTStL</li>
      <li>The relationship between increases in transmission capacity and the usable fraction of flexibility points is now governed by an input variable (elec/EoTCCwTC) rather than a hard-coded relationship, giving the EPS the flexibility to better represent renewables deployment and curtailment in power systems facing varying degrees of transmission constraints</li>
      <li>In the District Heat sector, heat pumps can be represented using the electricity fuel type.  dist-heat/EoCtUH now includes heat pump efficiency data.</li>
      <li>Metallurgical (feedstock) coal is now included in industrial coal use (indst/BIFUbC and indst/BPoIFUfE)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Added missing non-country multiplier for cement process emissions (in indst/BPEiC and indst/PERAC)</li>
      <li>Nuclear lifetime extension policy is no longer shown in U.S. web app because BAU data already incorporate extensions (to 80-year operating lifetimes) except where a plant is known to be closing sooner</li>
      <li>Labor now correctly receives a share of revenues from building retrofitting and from distributed solar deployment</li>
      <li>Fixed overly-high costs for utility demand response (DR) programs caused by outliers in input dataset</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <li>The price-based power plant early retirement mechanism has been redesigned.  It is now more realistic in situations with strong economic incentives for retirement, and it does not affect the BAU case.</li>
      <li>The mechanism for determining how much capacity of each electricity source may be built in a given year has been redesigned.  It is now dependent on installed capacity only for wind and solar PV.</li>
      <li>Flexibility points are no longer a hard limit on renewables construction or dispatch.  As before, renewables remain unconstrained until capacity equals flexibility points.  Thereafter, capacity factor of renewables is reduced proportionately to the overage of capacity beyond flexibility points.</li>
      <li>Consolidated vehicle suppliers, building component suppliers, and industrial equipment suppliers into a single cash flow entity, “capital equipment suppliers”.  The land use and forestry sector now also makes use of this new cash flow entity.</li>
      <li>Updated graphs and output variables to include new power plant types and distributed generation (solar and non-solar).  Updated graph color scheme.</li>
      <li>Cost outputs have been rebuilt for clarity and now have their own sheet.  Minor updates to several cash flow sheets to provide variables in the uniform format expected by the new cost outputs sheet.</li>
      <li>The contract-based dispatch mechanism has been renamed the guaranteed dispatch mechanism.  The BAU version of this mechanism is now always used in the BAU case, and the control lever that used to govern this behavior has been removed.  The policy “Boolean Use Contract Based Dispatch in Policy Case” has been renamed “Boolean Use Non BAU Guaranteed Dispatch Settings” and has been modified to work analogously to “Boolean Use Non BAU Mandated Capacity Construction Schedule.”</li>
      <li>Added the concept of “Bid” capacity factors, which are expected or peak time capacity factors (varying by plant type).  This system increases the importance of the electricity dispatch mechanisms.  Not used for peaking plant types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data Updates
    <ul>
      <li>The simulator’s first calculated year has been advanced from 2013 to 2015.</li>
      <li>Numerous data sources have been updated to their most current versions.</li>
      <li>BAU Subsidies have been updated to account for changes in legislation.</li>
      <li>The U.S. dataset no longer splits preexisting plants into “retiring” and “nonretiring” categories, to better reflect the fact that retirements in the U.S. do not correlate with specific technological or quality properties.  The model retains both of these quality tiers structurally, so that non-U.S. countries may still choose to make use of this distinction in their own datasets.</li>
      <li>In the Buildings Sector, the “residential” building type has been split into “urban residential” and “rural residential”.  Three policies are now subscripted by building type.</li>
      <li>All three included reference scenarios (CPP, EI, CO2eMin) have been updated to still hit their emissions targets (narrowly, for CPP and EI).</li>
      <li>Updated capital cost of new coal plants to include CCS, reflecting the latest regulations.</li>
      <li>BAU fuel costs now rely on the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook for values through 2016, increasing accuracy relative to the EIA Annual Energy Outlook.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Minor Improvements
    <ul>
      <li>Future demand response capacity in the BAU case now assumes linear rather than geometric growth, in line with FERC data source.</li>
      <li>Normalized Standard Deviation of New Output Costs is now a calculated variable, based on a weighted average of the Normalized Standard Dev of Dispatch Costs and the Normalized Std Dev of Capital Costs.</li>
      <li>Removed the BAU Regional Support Variance Multiplier, as these effects should now be accounted for in the normalized standard deviations.</li>
      <li>Added a collection of “Additional Electricity Sector Outputs” useful for examining the behavior of this sector in detail.</li>
      <li>Transmission capacity across the modeled region border now contributes to flexibility points.</li>
      <li>Added variable specifying the fraction of vehicles sold within the model boundary.  Those transportation policies that do not affect vehicles sold outside the modeled region now scale down their effects in proportion to the fraction of vehicles not sold within the region.</li>
      <li>In the Industry Sector, induced emissions beyond the model boundary (due to leakage) are no longer included in the modeled emissions total.  Leaked emissions are now only reported as a separate variable.</li>
      <li>The graph on the Buildings sector page now shows total CO2 emissions from the sector (summed across all three building types).</li>
      <li>Simplified input data calculations for various electricity plant properties (such as heat rates and expected capacity factors).</li>
      <li>Changed the names of many policies to remove “ by End Year” and “ in End Year” (which was a hold-over from before the simulator possessed a policy implementation schedule).</li>
      <li>In web app support sheet, “Billion Dollars” changed to “Output Currency Unit” and now draws from a .csv file, to aid in internationalization.</li>
      <li>Updated the default set of variables specified in OutputVarsToExport.lst for Python script users.</li>
      <li>The control lever “Boolean Use Twenty Year GWP Values” now pulls data from a .csv file rather than being set in Vensim like a policy lever.</li>
      <li>The BAU and Policy Case dispatch priorities and dispatch percentages now guarantee that natural gas peakers and petroleum-fired power plants will dispatch at their expected capacity factors.</li>
      <li>Renamed Non Hydro Storage to Battery Storage (to reflect the cost input data being used in the model).</li>
      <li>Biomass is now a value Buildings Sector fuel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected input data for BAU amount and potential amount of CCS.</li>
      <li>Corrected flexibility point and transmission connectivity coefficient calculations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
