    <p>The web interface allows the user to visualize Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) results through a variety of output graphs.  As of EPS 3.3.1, there are 174 different output graphs available in the web interface.  However, which graphs are shown in the web interface may be customized for different EPS country or regional adaptations.  Many graphs include more than one data series, such as a graph of power plant capacity by plant type (coal, nuclear, hydro, etc.).  Therefore, over 600 different data series are available in the web interface.  (Thousands more are available in the <a href="download.html">downloadable version</a> of the EPS.)</p>

    <p><em>These graphs present the relative impact of each enabled policy in a scenario in terms of the change in CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions. The “Total” wedge diagram includes all emission from the modeled region, while the sector-specific wedge diagrams only include direct emissions from those sectors.  Note that policies affectiong one sector may impact emissions in other sectors.  For example, electrification of industry (an Industry Sector policy) may affect emissions from the Electricity Sector.  Therefore, viewing a sector-specific wedge diagram may not show the full emissions impacts of that sector’s policies.  For a detailed description of how wedge thicknesses are calculated, see <a href="calculating-wedge-diagrams-and-cost-curves.html">Calculating Wedge Diagrams and Cost Curves</a>.</em></p>

    <p><em>These graphs show the abatement and cost-effectiveness of each policy. Each policy is displayed as a box whose horizontal width is based on the average annual abatement attributed to that policy (with abatement atributions made using the same procedure as in the wedge diagrams above) through 2050 or 2030. The height of each box, above or below the X-axis, is the average cost per ton CO<sub>2</sub>e abated. This is calculated by dividing the cumulative CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions reductions attributed to a given policy through 2050 or 2030 by the net present value of the policy-induced change in capital, operational, and fuel expenditures caused by that policy through 2050 or 2030.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Change in CapEx + OpEx</strong></p>

        <p><em>This graph shows one way to represent the overall costs of a policy package: the change in capital expenditures, fuel and operational expenditures (including labor), and additional carbon tax on process emissions. This graph displays each of these components in addition to their sum. Revenue-neutral taxes (i.e. taxes that are fully rebated to businesses and consumers, according to the policy package’s <a href="io-model.html">Government Revenue Accounting settings</a>, controlled by levers in the policy selector pane) and revenue-neutral subsidies (similarly controlled by Government Revenue Accounting settings) are considered cash transfers rather than capital and operational expenditures and are therefore added to or subtracted from the metric such that the total excludes these cash transfers. The “Change in CapEx and OpEx” reports only changes in amounts paid and excludes changes in amounts received (which always equal the changes in amounts paid). The changes in amounts paid can be positive or negative. For example, if a policy causes consumers to buy less fuel, then the “Change in CapEx and OpEx” will be negative (because consumers are spending less money on fuel as a result of the policy package). It does not matter that the fuel industry is receiving less money, because changes in receipts are excluded from this cost metric.</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>^ Total Only</strong></p>

        <p><em>This output graph reports only the Total Change in CapEx + OpEx from the metric above, to allow for multiple scenarios to be compared on the same graph.</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Government Cash Flow Accounting</strong></p>

        <p><em>This graph presents how the government handles added or reduced revenue. This metric is broken out into increases or decreases in each of the following five categories: Corporate Income Taxes, Payroll Taxes, Household Taxes, Budget Deficit, and Government Spending (i.e., increases or decreases in spending proportional to how the existing government budget is spent). Values on this graph should be read literally. For instance, a positive value for “budget deficit” indicates the government is running a higher budget deficit in order to make up for a reduction in its cash flow (rather than decreasing total amount spent or raising taxes), whereas a negative value for “budget deficit” indicates the government is using policy-driven increases in its cash flow to reduce the budget deficit (rather than increasing government spending or reducing taxes). Similarly, a positive value for “Change in Household Taxes” means tax receipts have increased, while a negative value indicates tax receipts have decreased. Thus, a policy package that increases government cash flow may be handled via accounting modes with a mixture of positive and negative values (such as increased spending combined with decreased household taxes). Users can control how the government handles changes in its revenues across these five categories by using the Government Revenue Accounting levers in the policy selector pane.</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Cumulative Change in National Debt</strong></p>

        <p><em>Change in national debt as a result of the selected policies. Changes to the budget deficit are cumulated across each year of the model run to find the change in the national debt (or surplus) relative to business-as-usual as of each modeled year.</em></p>

        <p><em>This graph presents the net effects of the selected policies on government cash flow prior to government decisions about how to handle its changes in cash flow (which can be controlled with the Government Revenue Accounting levers in the policy selector pane). This metric is broken out by sources of cash flow changes (Carbon Tax Revenue, Fuel Tax Revenue, EV Subsidy, Electric Generation Subsidy, Electricity Capacity Construction Subsidy, Distributed Solar Subsidy, Fuel Subsidy, National Debt Interest, Remaining Government Cash Flows). “Remaining Government Cash Flows” is often dominated by changes in tax receipts due to overall growth or shrinkage of the economy (GDP and Employee Compensation) but also includes changes in costs paid by government, such as spending on energy to power government buildings.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Cash Flow Change (by Entity)</strong></p>

        <p><em>Direct (first-order) policy-induced change in cash flow for each of nine entities tracked in the Energy Policy Simulator (Government, Non-Energy Industries, Labor and Consumers, Foreign Entities, Electricity Suppliers, Coal Suppliers, Natural Gas and Petroleum Suppliers, Biomass and Biofuel Suppliers, and Other Energy Suppliers). This metric is upstream of the macroeconomic input-output model and therefore does not include how government, households, and industries respend additional money (or how they compensate for reductions in money), so it does not capture economy-wide growth or shrinkage caused by the modeled policies. (See the graphs in the “Financial: Jobs, GDP, and Earnings” section for financial outputs that include policy-driven changes in economy size.) Since any money that is spent by one entity is received by another, direct cash flow changes sum to zero.</em></p>
