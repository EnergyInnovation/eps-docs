## Deprecated Documentation

The documentation pages listed below do not apply to the most recent version of the Energy Policy Simulator.  However, they contain information that may be relevant if using an older software version (which may be the latest available version for some geographic regions, if a region has not updated to the latest software).

  * [Notes on Carbon Tax Revenue Use](carbon-tax-revenue-use) - written for 1.4.2, no longer applicable after 2.1.1
  * [Testing Policy Contributions to a Policy Package](testing-policy-contributions) - The Python script uses the procedure from the EPS up through version 3.0.0.  In EPS 3.1.0, a more refined procedure was introduced.  To learn about the new procedure, see [Calculating Wedge Diagrams and Cost Curves](calculating-wedge-diagrams-and-cost-curves).
