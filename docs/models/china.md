title:  "China (2017, NCSC) Energy Policy Simulator"
---


The Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) is a computer model originally created by [Energy Innovation LLC](https://energyinnovation.org/) and adapted for China in partnership with China's [National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation (NCSC)](http://www.ncsc.org.cn/) and China's [Energy Research Institute](http://www.eri.org.cn/).

## Results

In 2016, the organizations listed above jointly released an Executive Summary with key findings for China based on analysis performed with the China EPS.  A new and improved version of the China EPS was released in 2017.  The results will be updated based on the new version of the simulator and new policy packages.  In the meanwhile, the 2016 documents remain available for download:

* the [executive summary](/download/20160704_ExecutiveSummary_EN--FINAL.pdf), in English
* the [executive summary](/download/20160703_ExecutiveSummary_CN.PDF), in Chinese
* a [presentation](/download/PolicySolutionsForClimateChange_EnergyInnovation.pdf), in English

## Note on Data in China (2017, NCSC) EPS

While the EPS software is free and open-source, the China (2017, NCSC) EPS contains some proprietary Chinese government input data that cannot be made available for download.  If you would like to download the EPS model and code, please [download the U.S. version of the EPS](../download).
