The Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) is a free and open-source computer model originally created by [Energy Innovation LLC](https://energyinnovation.org/) and adapted for Indonesia in partnership with [World Resources Institute](http://www.wri.org/), [WRI Indonesia](http://www.wri-indonesia.org/), and the [Institute for Essential Services Reform](http://iesr.or.id/).

## Results

In 2017, WRI and Energy Innovation jointly released [this technical note](http://www.wri.org/publication/indonesia-eps-tech-note) describing the structure, the input data sources, and the limitations and assumptions of Indonesiaâ€™s EPS.
