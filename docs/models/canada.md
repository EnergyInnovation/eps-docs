The Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) is a free and open-source computer model originally created by [Energy Innovation LLC](https://energyinnovation.org/) and adapted for Canada in partnership with the [Pembina Institute](http://www.pembina.org/).

## Reference Scenarios

Two reference scenarios are included with the simulator.  The "PCF" scenario strictly models policies that are committed to as part of the Pan-Canadian Framework, with no assumed improvement beyond that already announced.  For example, the "Carbon Tax" policy increases from $20/tonne in 2019 to $50/tonne in 2022, then holds constant at $50/tonne thereafter.

The "PCF Extended to Mid-Century" scenario increases the ambition of the PCF scenario by assuming that PCF policies do not stagnate when their announced end dates are reached, but rather, they strengthen at a constant rate through 2050 (or until the policy reaches its maximum possible setting, whichever comes first).  For example, the "Carbon Tax" policy increases at the same rate of $10/tonne per year from $20/tonne in 2019 to $330/tonne in 2050.

For a more detailed explanation of these scenarios, and answers to other common questions, please visit our [FAQ](https://www.pembina.org/reports/canada-energy-policy-simulator-faq-june-2019.pdf) page.
