title:  "China (NCSC) Energy Policy Simulator"
---

The China (NCSC) Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) is a free and open-source computer model created by [Energy Innovation (EI)](https://energyinnovation.org/) and adapted for China in partnership with China's [National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation (NCSC)](http://www.ncsc.org.cn/) and China's [Energy Research Institute](http://www.eri.org.cn/).

## Results

In 2016, the organizations listed above jointly released an Executive Summary with key findings for China based on analysis performed with the China (NCSC) EPS.  New and improved versions of the China (NCSC) EPS were released in 2017 and 2023. The results will be updated based on the new version of the simulator and new policy packages.  In the meantime, the 2016 documents remain available for download:

* the [executive summary](/download/20160704_ExecutiveSummary_EN--FINAL.pdf), in English
* the [executive summary](/download/20160703_ExecutiveSummary_CN.PDF), in Chinese
* a [presentation](/download/PolicySolutionsForClimateChange_EnergyInnovation.pdf), in English

## Note on Different Versions of the China EPS

While the EPS software is free and open-source, the China (NCSC) EPS contains some proprietary input data that are not available for download. It is one of two national-level China EPSs. If you would like to download the EPS model and code, please [request a download of the iGDP version of the China EPS](https://wkf.ms/3hIh7YF), which is built with publicly available data. Model results differ between the NCSC and iGDP versions of the China EPS due to differences in the proprietary input data used in the NCSC EPS and the public inputs used in the [iGDP EPS](https://china-igdp.energypolicy.solutions/).
