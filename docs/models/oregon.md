## U.S. State EPS Methodology

The [U.S. State EPS Methodology](../us-state-eps-methodology) page details our basic modeling assumptions, data sources, and methodology by sector. Additionally, we include information on the business-as-usual (BAU) and nationally determined contribution (NDC) scenario assumptions.
