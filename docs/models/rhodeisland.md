The Rhode Island Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) is a free and open-source computer model created by [Energy Innovation LLC](https://energyinnovation.org/) and [RMI](https://rmi.org/).  It is adapted from software originally created by [Energy Innovation LLC](https://energyinnovation.org/).

## U.S. State EPS Methodology

The [U.S. State EPS Methodology](../us-state-eps-methodology) page details our basic modeling assumptions, data sources, and methodology by sector. Additionally, we include information on the business-as-usual (BAU) and nationally determined contribution (NDC) scenario assumptions.

## Customized Scenario Developed for Rhode Island 2022 Climate Plan Update
In December of 2022, the Rhode Island Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4) voted to accept the Rhode Island 2022 Climate Update, an update to the state’s 2016 GHG emissions reduction plan. As part of this effort, Acadia Center, in collaboration with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM), developed a customized scenario using the Rhode Island Energy Policy Simulator. The customized scenario, titled “Rhode Island 2020 Climate Plan Update”, can be found in the policy scenario selector drop-down menu on the Rhode Island EPS homepage. 

The purpose of the scenario is to provide a high-level decarbonization analysis based on a select subset of key policies identified in the 2022 Climate Update and approximate the potential of these policies to assist the state in achieving Rhode Island’s overarching climate goal of a 45% reduction in GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. The customized scenario estimates that the subset of key policies will reduce emissions approximately 39% below the 1990 baseline by 2030. The scenario does not represent an exhaustive list of all policies and actions the state plans to implement to achieve the 2030 emissions target. 

Rhode Island’s 2022 Climate Update can be found [here](https://climatechange.ri.gov/sites/g/files/xkgbur481/files/2022-12/draft-2022-update-121422.pdf). Details on the EPS customized scenario analysis can be found in the technical appendix of the plan. Additionally, Acadia Center developed a research note highlighting some key results from the customized EPS scenario that can be found [here](https://acadiacenter.org/rieps/).
