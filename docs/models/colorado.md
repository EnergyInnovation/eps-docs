## U.S. State EPS Methodology

The [U.S. State EPS Methodology](../us-state-eps-methodology) page details our basic modeling assumptions, data sources, and methodology by sector. Additionally, we include information on the business-as-usual (BAU) and nationally determined contribution (NDC) scenario assumptions.

## **Roadmap Baseline Scenario Documentation**

The table below documents the policies included in the Roadmap Baseline Scenario ("Policy/Strategy" column) and the approach for modeling them in the Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) ("Modeled as…" column). The Roadmap Baseline scenario includes policies on the books in Colorado or expected to be on the books by about the end of 2023 to assess the impact of Colorado's climate policy portfolio. This scenario builds upon the EPS Business-as-Usual (BAU), the model foundation that uses publicly available data to capture projected changes in economic growth, technology and fuel costs, and existing policy commitments.

Note that in some cases, we have to translate policies into a representative use of EPS policy levers, so the text in the "Modeled as…" column does not always perfectly reflect the policy mechanism that exists in Colorado. However, the goal is to use EPS policy levers to reasonably reflect the effect of the Colorado-specific mechanism.

Policies in **black text** are included in the Roadmap Baseline scenario modeling. Policies in 
<font color='green'>**green text**</font> are provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that were integrated into the Roadmap Baseline scenario using EPS levers.

| **Electricity** |- (A) Resource usage necessary to achieve sector targets in HB21-1266<br/>- (B) Xcel retirement of Comanche Unit 3<br/>- \(C\) Funding for geothermal electricity from HB23-1252 grant program and HB23-1272 tax credits<br/>- <font color='green'>(D) IIJA Section no. 41001 projected to increase storage capacity online by 2026</font><br/>| - (A) As a proxy and to match the state’s modeled emission reductions as a result of Clean Energy Plans using data available in mid-2023, Clean Electricity Standard lever is set to 80% with the implementation schedule ramping up fully from 2022 to 2030. To represent the ramp-down of coal and ensure the model also captures the complete absence of coal generation after 2030, it is necessary to set the Early Retirement of Coal lever to 50 MW annually from 2025 through 2030. Note that the 80% Clean Electricity Standard value avoids double-counting 2030 emissions reductions associated with the Early Retirement lever.<br/>- (B) Additional early retirement of 0.25 GW of coal in 2031. To reflect both (A) and (B), the Early Retirement of Coal lever is set to 250 GW with implementation as follows:  <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2024 - 0% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2025 - 20% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;-  2030 - 20% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2031 - 100% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2032 onward - 0% <br/>- \(C\) Subsidy for geothermal electricity capacity construction set to 14% between 2023 and 2025.

| **Buildings**   |- (A) Clean Heat Plan legislation, SB21-264, assuming the 2030 gas consumption reduction is less than the 22% emissions target but above what would likely occur if all utilities reduced emissions in line with the cost cap established by the law<br/> | - (A) As proxies to represent the mix of gas consumption and emissions reduction strategies possible under Clean Heat Plans (CHPs), the Building Component Electrification lever is set to 65% for all components, and the Building Energy Efficiency lever is set to 25% for all building types, with the implementation schedule for both ramping up fully from 2021 to 2030. The modeling assumes that other major buildings sector policies (including HB22-1362, Building Performance Colorado, Building Electrification Plans, and HB23-1161) do not lead to substantial emissions impacts that are additional to what CHPs achieve, instead contributing to and enabling CHP achievement. Under that assumption, the Roadmap Baseline Scenario does not directly include buildings sector policies other than CHPs.<br/>|

Implementation increases from 0% to 12% 2023–2030, and 50% implementation occurs by 2050, to align with <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/82081.pdf">NREl analysis</a> on truck decarbonization pathways.<br/>- (H) Linear decrease in aviation emissions by approximately 5% by 2032 (using mode shifting lever as a proxy for sustainable aviation fuel impact and assuming 50% of sustainable aviation fuel produced in-state will be consumed in-state) Implementation increases from 0% in 2023 to full implementation by 2032.<br/>- (I) & <font color='green'>(J)</font> These policies are not modeled using a lever.

These levers are set to match annual expected abatement of ~0.65 MMT CO2e by 2030 for both GEMM Phase I and GEMM Phase II. GEMM I is modeled using the following industrial categories: <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Iron and Steel<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Cement and Other Nonmetallic Minerals <br/> GEMM II abatement is represented using: <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Food Beverage and Tobacco<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Refined Petroleum and Coke  <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Chemicals <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Glass and Glass Products <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Other Metals <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Metal Products Except Machinery and Vehicles <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Computers and Electronics <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Construction <br/>  These categories are used to approximate impacts rather than as representations of the exact industry category impacts expected from GEMM I and GEMM II. <br/> - (G) Incentive assumed to create demand pull that leads to an industry shift to hydrogen aligned with 33% achievement of NDC pathway and on the same timeline.

## **Near Term Actions Scenario Documentation**
The table below documents the policies included in the Near Term Actions Scenario (“Policy/Strategy” columns) and the approach for modeling them in the Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) (“Modeled as…” columns). The Near Term Actions scenario builds on progress represented in the Roadmap Baseline scenario with the addition of “Near Term Actions” listed in the Roadmap.

Note that in some cases, we have to translate policies into a representative use of EPS policy levers, so the text in the "Modeled as…" column does not always perfectly reflect the policy mechanism that exists in Colorado. However, the goal is to use EPS policy levers to reasonably reflect the effect of the Colorado-specific mechanism.

| **SECTOR**   | **POLICY/STRATEGY** | **MODELED AS…**   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Electricity** |- (A) Update Clean Energy Planning for 2040<br/> - (B) 2030 Clean Energy Plans and other resource plans in process during late 2023 but not finalized by December 2023 | - (A) & (B) To build on existing modeling for 2030 Clean Energy Plans, the Clean Electricity Standard lever is set at 100% in 2040. 2030 implementation is set at 82.6% in order to  represent  state analysis on 2030 electricity sector emissions projected  using  most recent utility plans  submitted  as of December 2023. 
| **Buildings**   | - (A) Develop 2035 Clean Heat Targets<br/> - (B) Changes in state and local land use policies to encourage infill development result in a decrease in single-family dwellings and an increase in multifamily complexes, which consume less fuel and are more energy efficient | - (A) The Building Component Electrification lever is adjusted to represent building on 2030 CHPs with action through 2035 that aligns with a pathway to achieve a 90% reduction in buildings sector gas consumption by 2050. Such a 2050 reduction could be modeled by increasing the sales of all-electric building components by about 8% every 5 years through 2050, so for this Near Term Action, the lever is set at 73% in 2035 to build on the 65% value in 2030. Modeling of this action therefore does not assume full achievement of a 90% by 2050 gas consumption reduction target but that 2035 progress aligns with that potential future course. The modeling also assumes that the other major buildings sector Near Term Actions do not lead to substantial emissions impacts that are additional to what 2035 CHPs achieve, instead contributing to and enabling their achievement. <br/> - (B) To match CDPHE analysis, which finds a 7.6% decrease in residential fuel consumption by 2050 relative to business-as-usual, the lever for Building Energy Efficiency Standards for rural and urban residential housing is set to 30%.

To match CDPHE analysis, the implementation schedule is as follows:  <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2021 - 0% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2022 - 6% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;-  2023 - 12% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2024 - 19% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2025 - 26% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2030 - 66% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2035 - 75% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2040 - 84% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2045 - 92% <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp;- 2050 - 100%

Also assumed that the state applies 25% of its CPRG funding toward industry. Modeled expected abatement of CAP grants and funding using $/emissions from first two projects. Electrification (Low Temperature) lever for all industries except for oil and gas extraction set to 55%, with implementation schedule 0% in 2023 and 100% by 2032 <br/> - (B) Assume that oil and gas operations become more efficient and electrify where possible at an aggressive rate by pulling the following levers for Oil and Gas Extraction: <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; -   Industry Efficiency set to 14%, increasing from 0% in 2021 to 100% in 2030. Note that this lever was already pulled previously to model a portion of the intensity standard <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; -   Electrification and Hydrogen (High Temperatures) set to 100%, increasing from 0% in 2023 to 100% in 2050 <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; -   Electrification (Low Temperatures) set to 100%, increasing from 0% in 2023 to 100% in 2050 <br/> - (C\) Matched analysis from CDPHE on the 2030 abatement potential of the midstream combustion rule relative to 2015 levels using the Industry Energy Efficiency Standard for Energy Processing and Gas Pipelines.

Pulled the Carbon Capture and Sequestration lever (for Process Emissions for  Cement and Other Nonmetallic  Minerals) to 90%, ramping up fully from 2023 to 2027 <br/> - (E) Matched expected 10% reduction in emissions from coal mining and landfills by 2030 relative to the Roadmap Baseline by pulling the following levers: <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Methane Destruction Coal Mining  set to 30% increasing from 0% in 2023 to 100% in 2030 <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Methane Capture  for Water and Waste set to 85% increasing from 0% in 2023 to 100% in 2030 <br/> - (F) Matched annual abatement of 1,000 metric tons expected from the Global Thermostat's DAC facility in Colorado. Note that the actual impact of DAC will scale with purchase of carbon offsets. Direct Air Capture lever in R&D set to 1%, implementation schedule 0% in 2023 and 100% in 2024
| **Land use, Agriculture, & Waste**   |- (A) Increasing Soil Health <br/> - (B) Increasing Funding for ACRE3 program (which targets agriculture efficiency) | - (A) Modeled abatement of approximately 470,000 metric tons of CO2e annually through 2026, which reflects CDA’s estimate for abatement levels if 10% of Colorado’s farms were managed for healthy soils  using  Improved Soil Measures lever set to  20% increasing from 0% in 2023 to 100% by 2026 <br/> - (B) Extrapolated 2022-2023 level of ACRE funding through 2025 and modeled expected  abatement using Industry Efficiency lever (agriculture and forestry) set at 5% increasing from 0% in 2023 to 100% in 2025

Xcel has submitted plans that are not yet finalized. A lower-emissions scenario assumes utilities achieve a reduction approximating the 22% target, and a higher-emissions scenario assumes utilities achieve a 6.6% reduction. 6.6% is a weighted average based on the low end of reductions among Xcel’s most recent submitted plans (8.3%) and reductions possible from other utilities (1.3%).<br/>| - **Pessimistic**: Building Component Electrification lever is decreased to 35% by 2030, and Building Energy Efficiency Standards lever is decreased to 20% by 2030 to approximate a 6.6% decrease in buildings sector gas consumption from 2015 levels by 2030.<br/>-**Optimistic**:Building Component Electrification lever is increased to 75% by 2030, and Building Energy Efficiency Standards lever is increased to 32% by 2030 to approximate a 22% decrease in buildings sector gas consumption from 2015 levels by 2030.<br/>| -Same as Roadmap Baseline<br/>

## Version History

### **4.0.2 - September 17, 2024**

* Updated to 4.0.2 EPS model platform
* Data Updates
  * Updated BAU to reflect components of the Inflation Reduction Act and latest EPA rules (see documentation)
  * Updated input data to the latest available version from data sources, including the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the 
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

### **3.4.3.10 – February 23, 2024**
* Pre-loaded the Near Terms Action scenario, which builds on progress represented in the Roadmap Baseline scenario with the addition of “Near Term Actions” listed in the CO Roadmap.

### **3.4.3.9 – February 6, 2024**
* Additional updates to the Roadmap Baseline scenario to more accurately represent the impact of policies across sectors.

### **3.4.3.8 – December 14, 2023**
* Data updates to emissions from industrial energy to match inventory data provided by the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment.
* Minor adjustments to the emissions reduction targets based on latest inventory data.

### **3.4.3.7 – October 19, 2023**
* Decreasing the buildings electrification lever for heating appliances in tthe Roadmap Baseline Scenario to 90% to model the combined impact of clean heat plans and HB23-1161

### **3.4.3.6 – September 22, 2023**
* Data updates to retire the coal plant, Comanche 3, in 2030 due to an existing retirement plan by the utility, Xcel. Additional minor tweaks were made to the hydrogen vehicle sales standard lever to model the state's hydrogen end-use tax credits

### **3.4.3.5 – September 7, 2023**
* Data updates to industry process emission reduction potential to increase the value of the methane capture and destruction policy levers in order to capture the impact of Colorado's oil and gas regulations to date

### **3.4.3.4 – September 1, 2023**
* Calibration to Colorado’s emissions inventory
  * Colorado EPS emissions are now calibrated to the state’s latest inventory. The input data remains calibrated to U.S. State Energy Data System (SEDS) data where possible.
* Incorporating federal funding
  * Federal funding from tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and major formula-funded provisions from the IRA and Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act (IIJA) are now included in Business-as-Usual. To do this, [Energy Innovation’s national model of the IRA](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Updated-Inflation-Reduction-Act-Modeling-Using-the-Energy-Policy-Simulator.pdf) was downscaled to Colorado using the “Low” scenario. 
* Roadmap Baseline scenario
  * This is now pre-loaded into the tool. This scenario reflects the state’s current policies, state policies expected to be in place by the end of 2023, and major provisions in the IRA and IIJA where Colorado expects to receive funds.

### **3.4.3.3 - June 9, 2023**

* Bug fix
  * Prevent rare Vensim error caused by negative ppriority values in ALLOCATE AVAILABLE function
