title: Electricity Sector (cash flow)
---
The "Electricity Sector - Cash Flow" tracks changes in cash flows in the electricity sector, covering all aspects of the electricity supply system and industries it affects. This includes cash flows for spending on fuel, construction and retrofitting, subsidies, carbon transportation and storage, operations and maintenance, demand response, imports and exports, transmission and distribution capital and operating costs, and costs of various market mechanism, such as the wholsesale energy market or the capacity market. Changes in cash flows are used to estimate changes in revenues and expenditures across different industries as well as to compute changes in the costs to deliver electricity to consumers.

## Cost Components

### Change in Fuel Costs

The following model structure calculates the change in cost, fuel industry cash flow, and taxes paid due to spending on fuels:

![change in fuel costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Fuels.png)

For each of the BAU and policy cases, we find the quantity of fuel consumed to supply electricity by multiplying the electricity generation (by power plant type) and the weighted average heat rate (efficiency) of power plants. Heat rates for CCS equipped plants reflect the lower efficiency of those plants. 

We find the total amount of money spent on electricity fuels (including taxes) by multiplying the amount of fuel consumed by the fuel cost per unit energy.  We find total taxes paid on fuels by multiplying the quantity of fuel consumed by the amount of fuel tax per unit energy.  The difference in amount paid between the BAU and policy cases gives the change in amount spent on electricity fuels, which we use to track changes in cash flows to fuel suppliers.  The difference in amounts of taxes paid gives the change in taxes, which will be assigned to government.  Taking the difference in amount spent minus the difference in taxes paid yields the change in cash flow for the fuel industry (disaggregated by fuel, because we break down this industry into more meaningful industry categories on the [Cross-Sector Totals](cross-sector-totals) sheet).

### Change in O&M Costs

The model compares both fixed and variable O&M costs using the structure shown in the screenshot below:

![change in O&M costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-OnM.png)

Neither "Annual Fixed O&M Cost per Unit Capacity" nor "Variable O&M Cost per Unit Output" can be affected by the policies chosen by the user.  Therefore, the only differences in O&M costs derive from different amounts of capacity of each power plant type, and different amounts of power generated by each power plant type, in the BAU and policy scenarios.  We take the quantities of capacity and generation straight from the "Electricity Sector - Main" and "Electricity Sector - BAU" pages.  Taking the difference between the sums of the BAU and policy O&M costs yields the overall change in O&M costs due to the policy package.

### Change in Generation Construction Costs

The following model structure calculates the changes in cost due to construction and retrofitting of electricity generating facilities:

![change in generation construction costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Generation.png)

The construction cost per unit capacity before subsidies is the same for most technologies in the BAU and policy cases. However, certain plant types subject to endogenous learning (covered in the [Endogenous Learning](endogenous-learning) sheet) can have policy driven capital cost declines. Differences in spending on generation and retrofitting costs arise from different quantities and types of power plants being constructed in each scenario as well as the extent to which endogenous learning changes the unsubsidized capital costs.  

The costs in each case are subtracted from each other, and an averaging function in Vensim (set to a 3-year averaging time) is used to even out unrealistic spikiness that comes from dramatically different amounts of capacity being built in adjacent years.  Three years was chosen as a compromise between more averaging and avoiding the average in of too many "zero" values from beyond the model run period (a shorter timeframe) and is a fair approximation of the average time to build new power plants (though this varies widely across differnt power plant types).

### Change in Construction and CCS Subsidy Payments

The following structure handles differences in construction and CCS subsidies for new and retrofit capacity caused by the policy package:

![change in construction and CCS subsidy payments](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Subsidies.png)

In the BAU case, capacity and CCS retrofit subsidies are applied based on BAU new and retrofit capacity. In the policy case these subsidies can be affected by multiple policies (which change the subsidy amounts) and the amount of capacity receiving incentives that is deployed. The change in capacity construction and CCS subsidies reflects diffrences in subsidy levels and new and retrofit capacity.

### Change in Zero Emission Credit Subsidies

Some regions, for example some US states, have additional subsidies for specific power plant types, such as nuclear power plants, often called Zero Emission Credits (ZECs). We calculate the change in these subsidy payments but comparing qualifying generation and subsidy amounts in BAU agains the policy scenario calculations.

![change in ZEC subsidies](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ZECs.png)

### Change in Generation Subsidies

Qualifying power plants may also received a subsidy per unit of electricity generation. We track changes in subsidy payments to qualifying generators by summing generation and multiplying subsidies by the generation amount. Subsidies are calculated separately in the electricity sector as discussed on the [Electricity Sector](electricity-sector-main) page and handle nuances like varying duration periods for the subsidies.

![change in generation subsidies](/img/electricity-sector-cash-generationsubsidies.png)

### Rebate for Sequestered CO<sub>2</sub>

In the event that there is a carbon price in BAU and/or the policy scenario, electricity suppliers receive a rebate, i.e. some positive cash flow, for sequestering CO<sub>2</sub>, as shown in the following structure:

![rebate for sequestered CO2](/img/electricity-sector-cash-CCSRebate.png)

First, we convert the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered from grams of pollutant to metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e.  (Although "This Year Pollutants Sequestered by Electricity Sector" is subscripted by pollutant, only CO<sub>2</sub> has a non-zero value for its amount of sequestration.)  We multiply this by the carbon tax rate to determine the "rebate" received for sequestering the CO<sub>2</sub>.  In reality, electricity suppliers are likely to have to pay carbon prices, so this "rebate" is merely a lowering of electricity suppliers' carbon pricing bills, rather than a net payment of money from government to electricity suppliers.

### Change in Spending on Batteries

The model determines the change in expenditures due to the construction of grid batteries and batteries at hybrid power plants.  Batteries are one of the technologies for which the model endogenously calculates cost declines based on total global deployment.  The cost declines are based on the number of doublings of battery capacity relative to the start year, as discussed in the [Endogenous Learning](endogenous-learning) code. Battery costs are broken into energy costs, power costs, and balance of system costs.

We find the difference in total new capacity of deployed battery storage in both the BAU and policy cases to determine the change in battery storage built this year.  This is multiplied by the cost of batteries per unit capacity, which is calculated here based on the endogenous learning calculations.   The structure is as follows:

![change in battery costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Batteries.png)

### Change in CCS Transportation and Storage Costs

We also track changes in the costs to transport and store CO<sub>2</sub> that has been captured at plants equipped with CCS. Spending on CO<sub>2</sub> transportation and storage costs is calculated on the [CCS](CCS) page and the electricity CCS portion of those costs in BAU and policy cases is compared to determine the change in costs.

![change in CCS transport and storage costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-CCSTransportStorage.png)

### Change in Decommissioning Costs

When power plants are retired, they have to be decommissioned. We track changes in spending on decommissioning costs. We compare the retiring capacity in the BAU and policy scenarios and multiply these by a power plant type specific decommissioning cost per unit capacity. We average these costs over a fixed set of years (3 years in the US EPS) assuming that decommissioning takes some amount of time to occur. We then compare these values for BAU and policy to get a total change in decommissioning costs.

![change in decommissioning costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-decommissioning.png)

### Change in Ongoing Capital Costs

Existing power plants have ongoing capital costs beyond O&M costs. For example, nuclear plants need somewhat regular capital investment to maintain safety. We track ongoing capital costs for the existing fleet by multiplying the surviving capacity by a power plant type specific weighted average annual capital cost per unit capacity to find the change in ongoing capital costs.

![change in decommissioning costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ongoingcapital.png)

### Change in Demand Response Costs

The model tracks deployment of demand resopnse capacity in the BAU and policy cases and tracks changes in spending on demand response across both scenarios. We sum the total demand response capacity across both scenarios, which is driven by input data and policy levers and allocate this across different providers, notably industries and consumers/labor, which reflect ths building/factility types providng the DR for cash flow tracking purposes. We then multiply by this by a capacity cost per unit DR capacity to estimate the total spending on DR across BAU and policy scenarios and compare these values to find the change. DR is assumed not to have any operating costs but rather only have capital costs.

### Change in Spur Line Construction Costs

### Change in Distribution Costs

### Change in Energy Market Costs

### Change in CES Costs

### Change in Capacity Market Costs

### Change in Revenue from RPS Qualifying Resources and Zero or Negative Dispatch Cost Resources

### Change in Transmission Costs

When the policy that increases transmission build-out is enabled, the following structure estimates the cash flow impacts:

![change in transmission construction costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Transmission.png)

Each year, the percentage increase in transmission capacity relative to BAU is provided by the policy set by the model user.  The default implementation schedule for this policy is a linear increase, meaning that transmission additional to the BAU case is built at a linear rate, reaching the user-specified percentage increase in the end year.  We subtract the percentage increase in transmission capacity relative to BAU last year (for example, 20%) from the increase relative to BAU this year (for example, 25%) to find the incremental increase this year as a percent of BAU transmission capacity (5% in this case).  This incremental increase is multiplied by the BAU transmission capacity to find the quantity of transmission constructed this year (in MW*miles).  Note that BAU transmission capacity is not constant, so these are percentages of different BAU values (20% of last year's BAU quantity vs. 25% of this year's BAU quantity), so the amount of transmission built each year is not the same, even thought the policy is ramped in linearly.  However, BAU transmission growth is slow, so the amount of transmission built in each year in response to the policy is very nearly constant.  Lastly, we multiply the quantity of transmission built this year by the construction cost per unit capacity to obtain the change in construction costs.

### Change in Electricity Import and Export Costs

The model also calculates the amount spent on buying electricity (from beyond the borders of the modeled region) and selling electricity to entities outside the borders of that region.  For imports, we estimate the price of electricity as sold by entities beyond the model borders via the BAU cost of electricity for industry.  (We use a BAU value because policies within the modeled region should not affect prices from producers beyond the modeled region.  We use the cost to industry because industry is a large consumer, as is a neighboring region, and it avoids the problem of some regions attempting to keep electricity prices artificially low for individual building owners.)

We multiply the price of imported electricity by the amount imported in the BAU and Policy cases, then take the difference to find the change in amount spent on importing electricity:

![change in electricity import spending](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ElecImportCash.png)

We perform a very similar calculation for electricity exports, but using the Policy case rather than BAU electricity price, since we're now considering electricity sourced from within the model borders, where policies are in effect:

![change in electricity export cash flow](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ElecExportCash.png)

## Summing Cash Flow Changes for Electricity Suppliers

We use the following structure to total the cash flow impacts from all of the cost components discussed above:

![summing cash flow impacts on electricity suppliers](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ElecSupplierImpacts.png)

We simply add all of the changes in cost together.  Positive changes (increases) in fuel costs, O&M costs, construction costs, battery costs, and transmission costs all count as negative cash flow for electricity suppliers.  Positive changes in subsidies paid and carbon tax rebates due to CCS count as positive cash flow for electricity suppliers.  Note we here use the umbrella term "electricity suppliers" to refer to the entities that do all of these things: buy new power plants, buy fuel to operate the power plants, receive subsidies for generating electricity, pay for new transmission lines, etc.  In reality, different entities might handle some of these tasks (e.g. independent power producers might build and run plants, a distribution utility might build transmission lines, another company or even homeowners might provide battery services, etc.)  It should be understood that impacts on "electricity suppliers" affect any or all of these entities insofar as they are responsible for the activities whose cash flow impacts are calculated in the model.

We allow changes in cash flow for electricity suppliers to affect the market price of electricity.  The variable used to perform this adjustment is calculated using the following structure:

![change in electricity supplier cost per unit electricity](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ElecPriceChange.png)

The actual adjustment of electricity prices is performed on the [Fuels sheet](fuels).  This assumes that increased costs are ultimately passed on to electricity consumers, as electricity sales are the ultimate source of funds for electricity suppliers.  If this effect is not desired, a user may enable the policy "Boolean Prevent Policies from Affecting Electricity Prices" on the "Policy Control Center" sheet.  This will disable this feedback loop and electricity prices will reflect BAU projections through 2030.  This might be most applicable if electricity prices are expected to be fixed irrespective of other regulatory initiatives (like a carbon tax, an RPS, etc.) and/or if the government is likely to absorb the cost to electricity suppliers for compliance with these policies, allowing electricity prices to remain the same.

## Assigning Cash Flows to Money Recipients

As with other sections of the model, changes in cash flow for one actor affect other actors.  The last section of this sheet calculates the impacts of cash flow changes for electricity suppliers on the actors they pay or who pay them.

The following structure deals with O&M costs, which happen to be the only type of electricity sector expense that is, in part, paid to consumers:

![recipients of O&M cash flow changes](/img/electricity-sector-cash-OnMRecipients.png)

The total change in O&M costs is split between equipment and labor, according to the current division of O&M costs between these two uses.  The change in O&M labor costs goes to consumers, less the taxes paid on that incremental payment to labor, which is calculated based on the marginal worker income tax rate.  These taxes will go to the government.

Changes in equipment, including the equipment portion of O&M, are handled via the following structure:

![recipients of equipment cash flow changes](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Equipment.png)

The change in capital costs (which consists of generation construction, battery, and transmission costs) are added to the equipment fraction of O&M to obtain a total "Change in Electric Equipment Purchases."  A fraction of this change is separated out for taxes, based on the capital equipment sales tax rate.  The remainder goes to capital equipment suppliers, which (like electricity suppliers) are one of the specially-broken-out industry categories in the Energy Policy Simulator (EPS).

This screenshot of the final piece shows the summation of all the cash flows affecting government: taxes on the labor fraction of O&M, taxes on equipment purchases, and taxes on electricity fuel purchases (calculated in the "Change in Fuel Costs" section above).  It also shows two quantities the government pays out: subsidies and a rebate for sequestering CO<sub>2</sub> in the event of a carbont tax:
