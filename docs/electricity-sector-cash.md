title: Electricity Sector (cash flow)
---
The "Electricity Sector - Cash Flow" tracks changes in cash flows in the electricity sector, covering all aspects of the electricity supply system and industries it affects. This includes cash flows for spending on fuel, construction and retrofitting, subsidies, carbon transportation and storage, operations and maintenance, demand response, imports and exports, transmission and distribution capital and operating costs, and costs of various market mechanism, such as the wholsesale energy market or the capacity market. Changes in cash flows are used to estimate changes in revenues and expenditures across different industries as well as to compute changes in the costs to deliver electricity to consumers.

## Cost Components

### Fuel Costs

The following model structure calculates the change in cost, fuel industry cash flow, and taxes paid due to spending on fuels:

![change in fuel costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Fuels.png)

For each of the BAU and policy cases, we find the quantity of fuel consumed to supply electricity by multiplying the electricity generation (by power plant type) and the weighted average heat rate (efficiency) of power plants. Heat rates for CCS equipped plants reflect the lower efficiency of those plants. 

We find the total amount of money spent on electricity fuels (including taxes) by multiplying the amount of fuel consumed by the fuel cost per unit energy.  We find total taxes paid on fuels by multiplying the quantity of fuel consumed by the amount of fuel tax per unit energy.  The difference in amount paid between the BAU and policy cases gives the change in amount spent on electricity fuels, which we use to track changes in cash flows to fuel suppliers.  The difference in amounts of taxes paid gives the change in taxes, which will be assigned to government.  Taking the difference in amount spent minus the difference in taxes paid yields the change in cash flow for the fuel industry (disaggregated by fuel, because we break down this industry into more meaningful industry categories on the [Cross-Sector Totals](cross-sector-totals) sheet).

### Generation O&M Costs

The model compares both fixed and variable O&M costs using the structure shown in the screenshot below:

![change in O&M costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-OnM.png)

Neither "Annual Fixed O&M Cost per Unit Capacity" nor "Variable O&M Cost per Unit Output" can be affected by the policies chosen by the user.  Therefore, the only differences in O&M costs derive from different amounts of capacity of each power plant type, and different amounts of power generated by each power plant type, in the BAU and policy scenarios.  We take the quantities of capacity and generation straight from the "Electricity Sector - Main" and "Electricity Sector - BAU" pages.  Taking the difference between the sums of the BAU and policy O&M costs yields the overall change in O&M costs due to the policy package.

### Generation Construction Costs

The following model structure calculates the changes in cost due to construction and retrofitting of electricity generating facilities:

![change in generation construction costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Generation.png)

The construction cost per unit capacity before subsidies is the same for most technologies in the BAU and policy cases. However, certain plant types subject to endogenous learning (covered in the [Endogenous Learning](endogenous-learning) sheet) can have policy driven capital cost declines. Differences in spending on generation and retrofitting costs arise from different quantities and types of power plants being constructed in each scenario as well as the extent to which endogenous learning changes the unsubsidized capital costs.  

The costs in each case are subtracted from each other, and an averaging function in Vensim (set to a 3-year averaging time) is used to even out unrealistic spikiness that comes from dramatically different amounts of capacity being built in adjacent years.  Three years was chosen as a compromise between more averaging and avoiding the average in of too many "zero" values from beyond the model run period (a shorter timeframe) and is a fair approximation of the average time to build new power plants (though this varies widely across differnt power plant types).

### Construction and CCS Subsidy Payments

The following structure handles differences in construction and CCS subsidies for new and retrofit capacity caused by the policy package:

![change in construction and CCS subsidy payments](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Subsidies.png)

In the BAU case, capacity and CCS retrofit subsidies are applied based on BAU new and retrofit capacity. In the policy case these subsidies can be affected by multiple policies (which change the subsidy amounts) and the amount of capacity receiving incentives that is deployed. The change in capacity construction and CCS subsidies reflects diffrences in subsidy levels and new and retrofit capacity.

### Zero Emission Credit Subsidies

Some regions, for example some US states, have additional subsidies for specific power plant types, such as nuclear power plants, often called Zero Emission Credits (ZECs). We calculate the change in these subsidy payments but comparing qualifying generation and subsidy amounts in BAU agains the policy scenario calculations.

![change in ZEC subsidies](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ZECs.png)

### Generation Subsidies

Qualifying power plants may also received a subsidy per unit of electricity generation. We track changes in subsidy payments to qualifying generators by summing generation and multiplying subsidies by the generation amount. Subsidies are calculated separately in the electricity sector as discussed on the [Electricity Sector](electricity-sector-main) page and handle nuances like varying duration periods for the subsidies.

![change in generation subsidies](/img/electricity-sector-cash-generationsubsidies.png)

### Rebate for Sequestered CO<sub>2</sub>

In the event that there is a carbon price in BAU and/or the policy scenario, electricity suppliers receive a rebate, i.e. some positive cash flow, for sequestering CO<sub>2</sub>, as shown in the following structure:

![rebate for sequestered CO2](/img/electricity-sector-cash-CCSRebate.png)

First, we convert the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered from grams of pollutant to metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e.  (Although "This Year Pollutants Sequestered by Electricity Sector" is subscripted by pollutant, only CO<sub>2</sub> has a non-zero value for its amount of sequestration.)  We multiply this by the carbon tax rate to determine the "rebate" received for sequestering the CO<sub>2</sub>.  In reality, electricity suppliers are likely to have to pay carbon prices, so this "rebate" is merely a lowering of electricity suppliers' carbon pricing bills, rather than a net payment of money from government to electricity suppliers.

### Spending on Batteries

The model determines the change in expenditures due to the construction of grid batteries and batteries at hybrid power plants.  Batteries are one of the technologies for which the model endogenously calculates cost declines based on total global deployment.  The cost declines are based on the number of doublings of battery capacity relative to the start year, as discussed in the [Endogenous Learning](endogenous-learning) code. Battery costs are broken into energy costs, power costs, and balance of system costs.

We find the difference in total new capacity of deployed battery storage in both the BAU and policy cases to determine the change in battery storage built this year.  This is multiplied by the cost of batteries per unit capacity, which is calculated here based on the endogenous learning calculations.   The structure is as follows:

![change in battery costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Batteries.png)

### CCS Transportation and Storage Costs

We also track changes in the costs to transport and store CO<sub>2</sub> that has been captured at plants equipped with CCS. Spending on CO<sub>2</sub> transportation and storage costs is calculated on the [CCS](CCS) page and the electricity CCS portion of those costs in BAU and policy cases is compared to determine the change in costs.

![change in CCS transport and storage costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-CCSTransportStorage.png)

### Decommissioning Costs

When power plants are retired, they have to be decommissioned. We track changes in spending on decommissioning costs. We compare the retiring capacity in the BAU and policy scenarios and multiply these by a power plant type specific decommissioning cost per unit capacity. We average these costs over a fixed set of years (3 years in the US EPS) assuming that decommissioning takes some amount of time to occur. We then compare these values for BAU and policy to get a total change in decommissioning costs.

![change in decommissioning costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-decommissioning.png)

### Ongoing Capital Costs

Existing power plants have ongoing capital costs beyond O&M costs. For example, nuclear plants need somewhat regular capital investment to maintain safety. We track ongoing capital costs for the existing fleet by multiplying the surviving capacity by a power plant type specific weighted average annual capital cost per unit capacity to find the change in ongoing capital costs.

![change in decommissioning costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ongoingcapital.png)

### Demand Response Costs

The model tracks deployment of demand resopnse capacity in the BAU and policy cases and tracks changes in spending on demand response across both scenarios. We sum the total demand response capacity across both scenarios, which is driven by input data and policy levers and allocate this across different providers, notably industries and consumers/labor, which reflect ths building/factility types providng the DR for cash flow tracking purposes. We then multiply by this by a capacity cost per unit DR capacity to estimate the total spending on DR across BAU and policy scenarios and compare these values to find the change. DR is assumed not to have any operating costs but rather only have capital costs.

![change in demand response costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-demandresponse.png)

### Spur Line Construction Costs

The EPS includes estimates of spur line costs, or the cost of running lines from a power plant to the bulk transmission system, in cash flow estimates. These costs are defined in input data and can vary by power plant type. Each power plant type can have an associated cost, in $/MW, that gets multiplied by new capacity to estimate the total spending on spurlines for each power plant types. These costs are averaged out over a set number of years, defined in input data, to avoid spikiness, and also to reflect the fact that like power plants, spurline construction often takes place over a duration exceeding a year. 

![change in demand response costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-spurlines.png)

### Transmission System Costs

Transmission deployment is endogenously estimated in the EPS and the model tracks changes in spending on transmission capital and transmission operating maintenance costs. Input data specifies the cost of new transmission construction per unit new capacity of various power palnt types. This data is multipled by the new construction of power plants to determine new spending on transmission capital. These values are averaged over several years, defined in input data, to reflect the time period over which it takes to physically construct transmission. Costs are compared between BAU and policy cases to determine the change in spending on transmission construction.

Transmission operating and maintenance costs are calculated based on the growth in total electricity generation capacity. Input data defines transmission O&M spending in the start year, and in subsdquent years this spending increases based on the growth in electricity generation capacity.

![change in transmission system costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-transmission.png)

### Distribution System Costs

Distribution system investment is endogenously modeled as a function of peak electricity demand. Capital costs are estimated based on the increase in peak load multiplied by a cost per unit increase in peak load. Operations and maintenance costs are similarly estimated, using start year costs and growing or shrinking these in future years based on the change in peak load. Peak load is defined as total electricity demand after adjusting for onsite generation, which can often reduce peak load.

![change in distribution system costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-distribution.png)

### Energy Market Costs

Annual energy market costs are calculated in the EPS. These costs are calculated using the hourly marginal dispatch costs calculated on the [Electricity Sector Main](electricity-sector-main) tab. They reflect the marginal hourly dispatch costs across the entire electricity system. Total costs are estimated by summing electricity dispatch from guaranteed dispatch and from least cost dispatch and multiplying by the market price in each hour, then summing over the year. Costs for resources dispatched under the RPS qualifying dispatch mechanism and the zero or negative dispatch cost mechanism are not included here, because it is assumed these resources have fixed contracts and guaranteed cost recovery. For example, many clean energy projects have power purchase agreements (PPAs) in which a price per megawatthour is agreed upon, with excess revenue credit back to the developer and shortfalls in revenue being made up by the offtaker (the purchaser of the power).

![change in energy market costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-energymarket.png)

### Clean Electricity Standard Costs

The EPS includes a clean electricity standard/renewable portfolio standard mechanism. This mechanism is discussed fully on the [Electricity Sector Main](electricity-sector-main) page, but reviewed here. The CES mechanism computes a credit price that drives sufficient incremental clean generation. The total costs of the market driven CES component, which includes both the CES credit costs as well as the required revenue for qualifying resources, are calculated in the "CES Costs for Market Based CES Mechanism" variable. Costs are estimated by multiplying the output of qualifying plants by the CES market price and the market revenue that would have been received. We assume that in each year the CES qualifying resources enter into a contract for their electricity as the sum of the CES credit price and the anticipated market revenue, i.e., that the credit price is guaranteed to those resources over the financial lifetime of the asset. We include hybrid resources as well in the CES mechanism. When energy market costs are calculated (discussed above) they do not include these resources to avoid double counting the revenue.

Additionally, as the CES approaches 100%, the EPS engages a mechanism to ensure sufficient clean firm/flexible capacity is available. The amount of capacity required and the threshold at which this requirement is triggered are determined by input data. As with the market based CES mechanism, it is assumed that these credits are made available at a fixed amount for the financial lifetime of the asset. These costs are estimateed by first finding the market price and then multiplying it by the capacity deployed under this mechanism.

These costs are fed into a stock and flow structure to reflect their avaialbiity during the lifetime of the assets and traack the total change in costs of a CES program over time. After the financial lifetime, the credits expire and the costs are reduced.

![change in CES costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-CES.png)

### Revenue from RPS Qualifying Resources and Zero or Negative Dispatch Cost Resources

For CES qualifying resources with dispatch beyond the anticipated CES dispatch and for non-CES qualifying resources with zero or negative marginal dispatch costs and which aren't dispatched through guaranteed dispatch, there is another set of calculations to estimate the system costs of dispatching those resources. These resources are expected to receive revenue just like plants dispatched through guaranteed dispatch and/or the least cost dispatch mechanism. We use the estimated amounts of these resource dispatched calculated on the [Electricity Sector Main](electricity-sector-main) page and multiply generation by the hourly marginal dispatch dispatch cost to get the total cost in each hour. We then sum across resources and hours to get the total cost per year. 

![change in revenue from RPS qualifying resources and zero or negatie dispatch cost resources](/img/electricity-sector-cash-zerocostrevenue.png)

Although these resources are handled in their own section, the sum of guarnateed dispatch, non-RPS qualifying resource dispatch, zero and negative cost dispatch, and least cost dispatch, is used to compute the total hourly costs using the marginal dispatch cost by hour. The only unique dispatch component in terms of calculating costs is CES/RPS qualifying dispatch, where we assume resources have out of market agreements for their electricity and so we handle them differently.

### Capacity Market Costs

The EPS includes a capacity mechahism to ensure sufficient capacity is available for periods of peak demand and limited resource availablity. As outlined on the [Electricity Sector Main](electricity-sector-main) page, one of the ways the model does this is by computing a capacity price that drives additional qualifying resources onto the system when capacity is needed. There are two stages to the capacity mechanism: one that only allows dispatchable resources (dispatchable reliability) and one that allows allow resources (residual reliability), accounting for availability during times of binding system need. Computed capacity payments are paid out to all qualifying resources, adjusted for their availability during the binding hour of the mechanism. Capacity prices are recalculated every year and only paid out on a yearly basis. This approach is meant to approximate a market based capacity construct.

A control lever setting allows the use of an alternative method. When this toggle is enabled, the capacity price is calculated similarly but only paid out to resources built in that year specifically for reliability purposes. The model assumes that the capacity payment is fixed annually for the financial lifetime of the asset being built. This approximates a different kind of market construct, such as a tolling agreement or the way in which a vertically integrated utility might contract for capacity over many years. This approach reduces the annual cost of the capacity mechanism but can lead to higher long term costs, depending on the specifics of the capacity need in the model region.

Battery storage is integrated into the capacity mechanism and payments follow the same structure, depending on whether or not the control lever is enabled. 

The structure belows covers calculation of these costs for both approaches and covering both traditional resources and battery storage resources. It also covers calculation of these costs for both the dispatchable reliabilty component and the residual reliability component. 

When the RPS/CES policy lever is set to a value of 100%, non-qualifying resources lose their elgibility for the capacity market, and this section includes variables and code to ensure that dynamic is captured.

![change in capacity costs](/img/electricity-sector-cash-capacity.png)

### Electricity Import and Export Costs

The model also calculates the amount spent on buying electricity (from beyond the borders of the modeled region) and selling electricity to entities outside the borders of that region.  For imports, we estimate the price of electricity as sold by entities beyond the model borders via input data specifying imported energy market prices.

We multiply the price of imported electricity by the amount imported in the BAU and Policy cases, then take the difference to find the change in amount spent on importing electricity.

For exports, we do something very similar, except that we adjust the exported electricity price by changes in the calculated electricity market prices in the model. This step is required because in BAU and policy scenarios where a lot of low marginal cost clean energy is deployed, the market price can drop significantly, and the export price should reflect changing market prices. 

In the future, we hope to make imports and exports more dynamic and to calculate prices endogenously.

## Summing Cash Flow Changes for Electricity Suppliers

We use the following structure to total the cash flow impacts from all of the cost components discussed above:

![summing cash flow impacts on electricity suppliers](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ElecSupplierImpacts.png)

We simply add all of the changes in cost together.  Positive changes (increases) in fuel costs, O&M costs, construction costs, battery costs, and transmission costs all count as negative cash flow for electricity suppliers.  Positive changes in subsidies paid and carbon tax rebates due to CCS count as positive cash flow for electricity suppliers.  Note we here use the umbrella term "electricity suppliers" to refer to the entities that do all of these things: buy new power plants, buy fuel to operate the power plants, receive subsidies for generating electricity, pay for new transmission lines, etc.  In reality, different entities might handle some of these tasks (e.g. independent power producers might build and run plants, a distribution utility might build transmission lines, another company or even homeowners might provide battery services, etc.)  It should be understood that impacts on "electricity suppliers" affect any or all of these entities insofar as they are responsible for the activities whose cash flow impacts are calculated in the model.

We allow changes in cash flow for electricity suppliers to affect the market price of electricity.  The variable used to perform this adjustment is calculated using the following structure:

![change in electricity supplier cost per unit electricity](/img/electricity-sector-cash-ElecPriceChange.png)

The actual adjustment of electricity prices is performed on the [Fuels sheet](fuels).  This assumes that increased costs are ultimately passed on to electricity consumers, as electricity sales are the ultimate source of funds for electricity suppliers.  If this effect is not desired, a user may enable the policy "Boolean Prevent Policies from Affecting Electricity Prices" on the "Policy Control Center" sheet.  This will disable this feedback loop and electricity prices will reflect BAU projections through 2030.  This might be most applicable if electricity prices are expected to be fixed irrespective of other regulatory initiatives (like a carbon tax, an RPS, etc.) and/or if the government is likely to absorb the cost to electricity suppliers for compliance with these policies, allowing electricity prices to remain the same.

## Assigning Cash Flows to Money Recipients

As with other sections of the model, changes in cash flow for one actor affect other actors.  The last section of this sheet calculates the impacts of cash flow changes for electricity suppliers on the actors they pay or who pay them.

The following structure deals with O&M costs, which happen to be the only type of electricity sector expense that is, in part, paid to consumers:

![recipients of O&M cash flow changes](/img/electricity-sector-cash-OnMRecipients.png)

The total change in O&M costs is split between equipment and labor, according to the current division of O&M costs between these two uses.  The change in O&M labor costs goes to consumers, less the taxes paid on that incremental payment to labor, which is calculated based on the marginal worker income tax rate.  These taxes will go to the government.

Changes in equipment, including the equipment portion of O&M, are handled via the following structure:

![recipients of equipment cash flow changes](/img/electricity-sector-cash-Equipment.png)

The change in capital costs (which consists of generation construction, battery, and transmission costs) are added to the equipment fraction of O&M to obtain a total "Change in Electric Equipment Purchases."  A fraction of this change is separated out for taxes, based on the capital equipment sales tax rate.  The remainder goes to capital equipment suppliers, which (like electricity suppliers) are one of the specially-broken-out industry categories in the Energy Policy Simulator (EPS).

This screenshot of the final piece shows the summation of all the cash flows affecting government: taxes on the labor fraction of O&M, taxes on equipment purchases, and taxes on electricity fuel purchases (calculated in the "Change in Fuel Costs" section above).  It also shows two quantities the government pays out: subsidies and a rebate for sequestering CO<sub>2</sub> in the event of a carbont tax:
