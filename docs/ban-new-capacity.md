title: Ban New Capacity of Specific Types
---

Policymakers may choose to prevent the construction or deployment of new electricity generating capacity of specific types, such as new coal-fired power plants.  A ban on new power plants may be motivated by concern about existing excess capacity, the need to lower emissions of damaging pollutants, or health and safety concerns.

Bans on new capacity can be directly promulgated at the national or subnational level or can be instituted via arduous permitting and technology requirements.

In the Energy Policy Simulator, this policy can also be used to represent standards that effectively ban the construction of new power plant types, such as stringent pollution control measures.
