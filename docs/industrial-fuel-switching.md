title: Industrial Fuel Switching
---
Policies promoting fuel conversion can be mandatory (e.g., banning the use of fossil fuels in certain industrial facilities or setting emissions thresholds), or market-based (e.g., taxing the use of fossil fuels or offering tax credits or incentives to use electricity or other clean fuels). Policies that price carbon emissions also create an incentive for facilities to switch away from using fossil fuels.

Direct electrification of industrial processes using heat pumps is the most efficient technology option, though some higher heat processes will require other electric technologies or the use of combustible fuels such as electrolytic hydrogen.
